# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mountpoint for Amazon S3. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

Please use the GitHub issue tracker to [report bugs](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.yml) or [suggest features](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature-request.yml).

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

Logs are also valuable for bug reports. Please read the [logging documentation](LOGGING.md) for details on how to capture verbose logs.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work -- we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source. Please focus on the specific change you are contributing; we value multiple small pull requests that are easier to review.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering the default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.
