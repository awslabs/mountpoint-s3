# mountpoint-s3-crt-sys

This crate provides automatically generated Rust FFI bindings to the [AWS Common Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/common-runtime.html)
for use by [Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3).

**This crate is not intended for general-purpose use and we consider its interface to be unstable.**
Customers looking for general-purpose AWS client functionality in Rust should use the official [AWS SDK for Rust](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/).
