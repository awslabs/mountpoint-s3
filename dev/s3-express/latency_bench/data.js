          "message": "Add network config to all component benchmarks (#1284)\n\nThis change introduces both the CRT's target network throughput\nconfiguration and the network interface configuration to each of the\nbenchmarks for layers/components in Mountpoint's read path.\n\nThese are added primarily to support performance investigations, so we\ncan identify where there are gaps in performance and narrow them to\nimprove throughput of Mountpoint overall.\n\nThe target throughput default of 10.0 Gbps is removed on the lowest\nlevel of the benchmark, given we don't know what the default is for the\nCRT itself. It is left in place on all other layers as we default the\nvalue to 10.0 Gbps inside Mountpoint's S3 client.\n\n### Does this change impact existing behavior?\n\nNo, adds new arguments to benchmark scripts only. Even in those scripts,\nwe alias any command line arguments that change.\n\n### Does this change need a changelog entry? Does it require a version\nchange?\n\nNo, this is benchmarking changes only.\n\n---\n\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made\nunder the terms of the Apache 2.0 license and I agree to the terms of\nthe [Developer Certificate of Origin\n(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Carl Jones <djonesoa@amazon.com>",

          "message": "Fix race condition in GetObject that could result in empty responses (#1334)\n\nAddress an issue in the `Stream` implementation for\n`S3GetObjectResponse` that could immediately return `None` (i.e.\nterminate the stream) when detecting that the meta request had\ncompleted, before returning previously received parts. Reported in\n#1331.\n\nThe fix changes the mechanism used to extract the response body parts\nand the request completion from the meta request callbacks. Instead of\nmultiple independent channels, it introduces a single channel that\nsupports multiple `S3GetObjectEvent`s. The events in the new channel\nmatch the order in which the callbacks are invoked, which is guaranteed\nby the CRT. The events channel also includes the `Headers` event,\navoiding the need of a separate channel to await for the headers to be\nreturned.\n\nWhen using Mountpoint, an occurrence of this issue would result in a\nread request failing with an `Input/output error`, with a warning entry\nin the logs containing this message:\n```\nmountpoint_s3_fs::fuse: read failed with errno 5: get request failed: get request terminated unexpectedly\n``` \nNote however that we were not able to trigger the issue in our tests.\n\n### Does this change impact existing behavior?\n\nNo.\n\n### Does this change need a changelog entry? Does it require a version\nchange?\n\nBug fix entry and increase patch version.\n\n---\n\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made\nunder the terms of the Apache 2.0 license and I agree to the terms of\nthe [Developer Certificate of Origin\n(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Alessandro Passaro <alexpax@amazon.co.uk>",

Follow-up to the changes in #1334.\n\nWith this change, `S3CrtClientInner` provides 4 methods:\n* `meta_request_with_callbacks`: the lowest-level method, which allows\nmore customization through callbacks. It is the basis for the other\nmethods and it is used directly by `get_object` and `put_object`.\n* `meta_request_with_body_payload`: simpler variant that returns the\nresponse body. Used by `list_object` and `get_object_attributes`.\n* `meta_request_with_headers_payload`: variant returning the headers,\nbut no body. Used by `head_object` and `put_object_single`.\n* `meta_request_without_payload`: simplest variant, only returns error.\n\n### Does this change impact existing behavior?\n\nNo.\n\n### Does this change need a changelog entry?

          "message": "`GetObjectResponse` returns part content as `Bytes` rather than `Box<[u8]>` (#1348)\n\nModify the `GetBodyPart` type streamed from `GetObjectResponse` so that\nit exposes the part content as a `Bytes` type, rather than as a\n`Box<[u8]>`. This is an API breaking change for `mountpoint-s3-client`,\nwhich will require minor adjustments for users consuming the part\ncontent. The switch to `Bytes` will enable the introduction of different\nbuffer allocation strategies in future releases.\n\n### Does this change impact existing behavior?\n\nNo functional changes, but it is a minor API breaking change.\n\n### Does this change need a changelog entry? Does it require a version\nchange?\n\nYes, it changes `mountpoint-s3-client` public API.\n\n---\n\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made\nunder the terms of the Apache 2.0 license and I agree to the terms of\nthe [Developer Certificate of Origin\n(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).\n\nSigned-off-by: Alessandro Passaro <alexpax@amazon.co.uk>",
