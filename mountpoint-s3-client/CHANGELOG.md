##Â Unreleased

### Other changes

* Add support for overriding the number of threads used by the Event Loop.
  ([#1240](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1240/))
* The ECS credentials provider now performs retries in the event of some failures. ([awslabs/aws-c-auth#259](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-auth/pull/259/))

## v0.12.0 (January 20, 2025)

### Breaking changes

* `get_object` method now waits for the response headers before returning and may report errors earlier.
  Moreover, its return type on success has been renamed to `GetObjectResponse` (was `GetObjectRequest`).
  ([#1171](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1171))
* `get_object` method now requires a `GetObjectParams` parameter.
  Two of the existing parameters, `range` and `if_match` have been moved to `GetObjectParams`.
  ([#1121](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1121))
* `increment_read_window` and `read_window_end_offset` methods have been removed from `GetObjectResponse`.
  `ClientBackpressureHandle` can be used to interact with flow-control window instead, it can be retrieved from `backpressure_handle` method.
  ([#1200](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1200))
* `head_object` method now requires a `HeadObjectParams` parameter.
  The structure itself is not required to specify anything to achieve the existing behavior.
  ([#1083](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1083))
* `HeadObjectResult` no longer contains an `ObjectInfo` struct.
  Instead, it returns the object attributes as individual fields on the `HeadObjectResult`.
  The entity tag field has also changed and is now of type `ETag` rather than `String`.
  ([#1058](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1058))
* `HeadObjectResult` no longer provides the bucket and key used in the original request.
  ([#1058](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1058))
* Both `ObjectInfo` and `ChecksumAlgorithm` structs are now marked `non_exhaustive`, to indicate that new fields may be added in the future.
  `ChecksumAlgorithm` no longer implements `Copy`.
  ([#1086](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1086))
* `put_object` method now waits for the `CreateMultipartUpload` request to complete before returning and may report errors earlier.
  ([#1192](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1192))

### Other changes

* Add support for custom telemetry handlers.
  ([#1080](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1080))

  ([#1228](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1228))
* Add support for object metadata in GET requests.
  ([#1065](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1065))
* `HeadObjectResult` now includes the server-side encryption settings used when storing the object.
  ([#1143](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1143))
* Add parameter to request checksum information as part of a `HeadObject` request.
  If specified, the result should contain the checksum for the object if available in the S3 response.
  ([#1083](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1083))
* Add parameter to request checksum information as part of a `GetObject` request.
  If specified, calling `get_object_checksum` on `GetObjectRequest` will return the checksum information.
  ([#1123](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1123))
* Expose checksum algorithm in `ListObjectsResult`'s `ObjectInfo` struct.
  ([#1086](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1086),
  [#1093](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1093))
* `ChecksumAlgorithm` has a new variant `Unknown(String)`,
  to accomodate algorithms not recognized by the client should they be added in future.
  ([#1086](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1086))
* Allow to specify any of the supported checksum algorithms when uploading objects with `put_object_single`.
  ([#1157](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1157))
* Amazon S3 introduces support for AWS Dedicated Local Zones.
  ([awslabs/aws-c-s3#465](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-s3/pull/465))
