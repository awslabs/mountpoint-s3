## Unreleased

* Rollback underlying CRT client. ([#1666](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1666))

## v0.19.2 (October 17, 2025)

* Upgrade toolchain to Rust 1.90. ([#1650](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1650))
* Update to latest CRT dependencies.

## v0.19.1 (September 15, 2025)

* Update `tracing-subscriber` from `0.3.19` to `0.3.20`. ([#1590](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1590))

## v0.19.0 (July 28, 2025)

### Breaking changes

  ([#1515](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1515))
  ([#1520](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1520))
  ([awslabs/aws-c-s3#533](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-s3/pull/533))
  ([awslabs/aws-c-s3#536](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-s3/pull/536))

## v0.17.0 (Jun 27, 2025)

### Breaking changes

* Reduce memory fragmentation and peak usage by avoiding copying data returned by GetObject into newly allocated buffers.
  Callers of the `get_object` method are now responsible for returning the buffers to the internal memory pool by dropping
  the received `Bytes` instances after use. Failure to do so may eventually lead to reduced or zero throughput when the
  memory pool reaches capacity.

* Fix missing credential caching when using `S3ClientAuthConfig::Profile` credential configuration.
  ([#1398](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1398))

## v0.14.0 (April 9, 2025)

### Breaking changes

* `GetObjectResponse` returns part content as `Bytes` rather than `Box<[u8]>`.
  ([#1348](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1348))

## v0.13.3 (April 9, 2025)

* Fix an issue where GetObject requests may not be cancelled.
  ([#1355](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1355))

  ([#1240](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1240))
* The ECS credentials provider now performs retries in the event of some failures.
  ([awslabs/aws-c-auth#259](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-auth/pull/259))
* Export missing types in public API which previously required a direct dependency on `mountpoint-s3-crt`.
  ([#1248](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1248))

## v0.12.0 (January 20, 2025)

### Breaking changes

* `get_object` method now waits for the response headers before returning and may report errors earlier.
  Moreover, its return type on success has been renamed to `GetObjectResponse` (was `GetObjectRequest`).
  ([#1171](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1171))

  The structure itself is not required to specify anything to achieve the existing behavior.
  ([#1083](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1083))
* `HeadObjectResult` no longer contains an `ObjectInfo` struct.
  Instead, it returns the object attributes as individual fields on the `HeadObjectResult`.
  The entity tag field has also changed and is now of type `ETag` rather than `String`.
  ([#1058](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1058))
* `HeadObjectResult` no longer provides the bucket and key used in the original request.
  ([#1058](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1058))

  ([#1086](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1086))
* `put_object` method now waits for the `CreateMultipartUpload` request to complete before returning and may report errors earlier.

  If specified, the result should contain the checksum for the object if available in the S3 response.
  ([#1083](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1083))
* Add parameter to request checksum information as part of a `GetObject` request.
  If specified, calling `get_object_checksum` on `GetObjectRequest` will return the checksum information.
  ([#1123](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1123))
* Expose checksum algorithm in `ListObjectsResult`'s `ObjectInfo` struct.
  ([#1086](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1086),
  [#1093](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1093))
* `ChecksumAlgorithm` has a new variant `Unknown(String)`,
  to accomodate algorithms not recognized by the client should they be added in future.
  ([#1086](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/1086))
* Allow to specify any of the supported checksum algorithms when uploading objects with `put_object_single`.
