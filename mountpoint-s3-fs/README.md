# Mountpoint S3 FS (Unstable)

## ⚠️ Warning: Unstable API ⚠️
This library implements the core functionality of Mountpoint for Amazon S3. The API interface is **unstable** and subject to **significant changes**.

## Overview
Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a high-throughput file client for mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system.
This library provides an implementation of key Mountpoint functionality but should be considered as a **work-in-progress**.
We recommend all customers to use the official Mountpoint releases instead: https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/releases

## Limitations
- **API Instability:** The API will change soon and will introduce breaking changes.
