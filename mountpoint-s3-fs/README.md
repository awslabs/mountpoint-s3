# Mountpoint S3 FS (Unstable)
This library implements the core functionality of Mountpoint for Amazon S3. The API interface is **unstable** and subject to **significant changes**.

## Overview
Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a high-throughput file client for mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system.

**This crate is not intended for general-purpose use and we consider its interface to be unstable.**

We recommend all customers to use the official Mountpoint releases instead: https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/releases
