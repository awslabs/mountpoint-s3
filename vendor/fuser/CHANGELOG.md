* Add method to `Session` to unmount non-`Send` `Filesystem`s

## 0.11.1 - 2022-08-24
* Improve an error message when using libfuse2

## 0.11.0 - 2022-03-05
* Add `spawn_mount2()`
* Deprecate `spawn_mount()`

## 0.10.0 - 2022-01-06
* Improve error messages
* Support compiling with musl
* Default `link()` & `symlink()` now return EPERM instead of ENOSYS

## 0.9.1 - 2021-09-07
* `forget` and `batch_forget` no longer require that `AllowRoot` be set

## 0.9.0 - 2021-08-31
* Ensure that `Filesystem::destroy` is always called, when the filesystem is unmounted
* Remove request parameter from `Filesystem::destroy`.
* Make `fuse_forget_one` public, so that `Filesystem::batch_forget` can be implemented by users.
* Fix `batch_forget`. Previously, it always received an empty list of inodes.
* Fix `MountOption::AllowRoot`. Previously, using it resulted in a crash.

## 0.8.0 - 2021-06-11

## 0.6.0 - 2020-11-22
* Make `spawn_mount()` safe

  libfuse and the associated constants in libc
